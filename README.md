Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client was DriverPass. They wanted a system designed that would allow for prospective driving students to be able to schedule driving lessons with instructors and be able to interact with course material in online lessons.

What did you do particularly well?
I think I did particularly well in designing UML use case diagrams, and then using those to create UML activity and sequence diagrams. Thinking through what would be necessary for the system. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I would do a better job of writing the UML map. I didn't include any methods because they weren't required, but I think I could have thought of some basic ones to include. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I listened to the client and read the client's interview transcripts to see what they wanted. What could be done I translated into UML diagrams for ease of coding later on. It's important to consider their needs because they are ultimately who you are designing the program for. They will be the ones who use it at the end. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach software design the same way I would write a paper or any other large project. I like to have a good road map to work with so that I can see where I'm going. Even something simple can be very helpful in anticipating future needs.
